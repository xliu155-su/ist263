        <h2>Travel Tips</h2>

        <p>It’s not uncommon for restaurants to close their kitchens at 9.30pm. If you’ve left it too late to grab dinner, the chances are you may need to travel for it – because you’re not going to find somewhere open just by walking around. In the CBD shops are open till 7pm at the latest, and everywhere else they close at around 5pm. If you’re planning to hit the boutiques in Bondi or Barangaroo, make sure you give yourself enough time. Individual hours vary from store to store, so check ahead to avoid closed doors.</p>

        <p>Summer is bushfire season in Australia. If you’re going out of town, particularly if you're heading into the bush, make sure you check the day’s fire hazard warnings, and when the smoke gets thick in the city – and at times it can be choking ¬– keep an eye on the air quality rating in your area.</p>
