        <h2>Travel Tips</h2>

        <p>Taxis are generally very expensive in New York and if you’re in a rush, traffic will make it about the same speed (or slower) than the subway. Sometimes, walking is even faster. If you want to call a taxi in New York City, this is how to do it: Stand on the curb NOT by a bus stop, put your arm confidently UP and stand there intensely looking at the cars. </p>

        <p>Do have your Metrocard ready to swipe and know how to use it. Otherwise, step aside and let others pass until you’re ready and have learned by watching. And, yes, it’s a petri dish of bacteria, but hold onto the poles inside the train with your hands so other people around you have space to hang on, too. This is exactly why those mini bottles of hand sanitizer were created in the first place.</p>
